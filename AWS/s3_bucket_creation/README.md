# Terraform s3_Bucket_Creation

 Script


This folder contains Terraform scripts to create an AWS s3_Bucket_Creation along with associated resources. The scripts are organized into separate files for better clarity and maintainability.
## Prerequisites

 
- Terraform CLI installed: [Download and install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials: [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
## Installation


```bash
yum install terraform
```
## Usage


1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone http://10.16.1.53/devops/devops-templates.git
```


2. Navigate to the `s3_bucket_creation
` directory:


```bash
cd devops-templates/s3_bucket_creation

```


3. Create a `variables.tf` file with the required variables. For example:


```hcl
variable "region" {
  type        = string
  description = "The region to create/manage resources in"
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "bucket_prefix" {
  type        = string
  description = "The prefix to use for the S3 bucket name"
  default     = "tf-bucket"
}

```


4. Review and customize the `variables.tf` file to adjust any default values or add new variables as needed.


5. Review and customize the `main.tf` file to configure your s3_Bucket_Creation. Comments are provided to guide you through the options.


6. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

 

```bash
terraform init
```

 

7. Preview the changes that will be applied:

 

```bash
terraform plan
```

 

8. Apply the changes:

 

```bash
terraform apply
```

 

9. Confirm the changes by typing `yes` when prompted.

 

## Clean Up

 

To remove the s3_Bucket_Creation and related resources, you can use:

 

```bash
terraform destroy
```

 

## Important Notes

 

- Ensure that sensitive information such as AWS credentials or secrets are not hardcoded in any of the files. Use environment variables, AWS profiles, or other secure methods to manage credentials.
- Always follow best practices for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) securely.
